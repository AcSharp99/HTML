<h2 id ="c1" > Chapter 1: Introduction</h2>

<p>
<b>Concept of WWW : </b>
<p><li><b>WWW</b> is stands for World Wide Web.
The World Wide Web (WWW)is a global information medium which users can read and write
via computer connected to the internet.</p>
<li>The  Web,  or 
World  Wide  Web,  is  basically  a  system  of  Internet  servers
that  supportspecially formatted  documents.
The
documents  are  formatted  in  a  markup  language  called  HTML 
(Hypertext  Markup  Language)  that  supports  links  to  other  documents,  as  well  as  graphics, 
audio
, and video files.<br><br>
<li>In short,
<b>World Wide Web (WWW)</b>
is collection of text pages, digital photographs,
music files, 
videos, and animations you can access over the Internet.<br>
<li>Web  pages  are  primarily  text  documents  formatted  and  annotated  with  Hypertext  Markup 
La
nguage  (HTML).  In  addition  to  formatted  text,  web  pages  may  contain  images,  video,  and 
software  components  that  are  rendered  in  the  user's  web  browser  as  coherent  pages  of 
multimedia content.<br><br>
<li>The  terms  Internet  and  World  Wide  Web  are  often  used  without  much  distinction.  However, 
the two are not the same. <br><br>
<li>The  Internet  is  a  global  system  of  interconnected  computer  networks.  In  contrast,  the  World 
Wide  Web  is  one  of  the  services  transferred  over 
these  networks.  It  is  a  collection  of  text 
documents  and  other  resources,  linked  by  hyperlinks  and  URLs,  usually  accessed  by  web 
browsers, from web servers.<br><br>
<li>There  are  several  applications  called 
Web  browsers
that  make  it  easy  to  access  the  World 
Wide Web; 
For example: Firefox ,
Microsoft's Internet 
Explorer, Chrome Etc.<br><br>
<li>Users  access  the  World
-
Wide  Web  facilities  via  a  client  called  a  browser,  which  provides 
transparent access to the WWW servers.
User can access WWW via two way such us :<pre>               </pre>
<b>History of 
WWW:</b>
<P><li>Tim  Berners
-Lee,  in 1980  was  investigating  how  computer  could  store  information  with 
random links. In 1989, while working at European Particle Physics Laboratory, he proposed to 
idea  of  global hypertext space  in  which  any network-accessible  information  could be referred 
to  by  single .<br>
<b> "universal Document Identifier"</b>.
After  that 
in  1990,  this  idea  expanded  with 
further program 
and knows
as 
World Wide Web.<br><br>
<b>Internet and WWW</b><br><br>

<li>The  Internet,  linking  your  computer  to  other  computers  around  the  world,  is  a  way  of 
transporting content. The Web is software that lets you use that content...or contribute your 
own.  The  Web,  running  on  the  mostly  invisible  Internet,  is  what  you  see  and  click  on  in  your 
computerâ€™s browser.

<h2 id="c2">Chapter 2: What is HTML?</h2>
<b>What is HTML?</b><br><br>
<li>Stands for Hypertext Markup Language. <br><br>
<li>Most documents that appear on the World Wide Web were written in HTML. <br><br>
<li>HTML is a markup language, not a programming language. In fact, the term HTML is an acronym that 
stands for Hypertext Markup Language. <br><br>
<li>We can apply this markup language to your pages to display text, images, sound and movie files, and 
almost any other typ
e of electronic information. <br><br>
<li>We  use  the  language  to  format  documents  and  link  them  together,  regardless  of  the  type  of 
computer with which the file was originally created.

<h2 id="c3">Chapter 3: What is Javascript?</h2>

<li>HTML  and  CSS  concentrate  on  a  static  rendering of a  page;  things  do  not  change  on  the  page  over 
time, or because of events.<br><br>
<li>To do these things, we use scripting 
languages, which allow content to change dynamically.<br><br>
<li>Not only this, but it is possible to interact with the user beyond what is possible with HTML.<br><br>
<li>Scripts are programs just like any other programming language; they can execute on the client side 
or the s
erver.<br>
